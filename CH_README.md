# ConversationHandling

### Conversation Handler group 
#### We extended the current IM to handle utterances with user-IDs to serve as a connection between the slackbot (created by Slack Front-End team) and Companions. We also trained multiple questions of the 3 different types using newly predicates that were ontologized by the Teaching Kiosk Team. 
#### The end result is an end-to-end connection between the slackbot <-> Companions.

### Setup
#### Add/replace files in the QRG directory.
